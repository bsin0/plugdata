# plugdata guitar effects module
The motivation for this personal project is to create modular effects for an aging old pedalboard which sits in a spare room. Some of the features i wanted from my effects was not possible in an analog board such as:
- Effect presets
- Scene presets
- Tap tempo delay with note value and time signature selection
- potential for endless tweaking..
The patches were made in plugdata, primarily using the following externals: ELSE and Audiolab.

It should work as long as you have a pc with PlugData, the above exernals and an audiointerface.
